# 4th Year Emerging Technology

----------

----------


The Programs, notebooks and files contained here have multiple purposes:

- A Numpy notebook that shows how the numpy package works and the different distributions that are used with numpy.
- A Iris Dataset notebook that shows how keras can learn from data set created using flowers and can be read in and we can use to determine an unknown flower and test the neural network to narrow down which flower we have input.
- A Mnist Notebook that shows how to use the Mnist data set to identify handwritten digits.
- The main Project program written in python and allows a user to write an image on a canvas and will train a neural network to identify what the user have written.
 

## Getting Started

----------


These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Prerequisites

----------
* Anaconda - A free and open source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for data science and machine learning related applications.
* Tkinter - A GUI used as standard in Python, We will use this to Take a Digit from the user.
* Keras - A High level machine learning API, used to train neural networks.
* Numpy - A fundamental package for scientific computing in python. We use it for array handling and random distributions.
* Matplotlib - 2D plotting library for python. We use it to show plots in our notebooks.
* SKlearn - Used for machine learning in Python.
* Gzip - Lossless Compression and Decompression utility we use to manage the MNist Data Set.
* Pillow - an image library in python. We will use it to manage images for our programs.

### Installing

----------
