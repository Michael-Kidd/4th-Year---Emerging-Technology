# 4th-Year---Emerging-Technology

The Programs, notebooks and files contained here have multiple purposes:

- A Numpy notebook that shows how the numpy package works and the different distributions that are used with numpy.
- A Iris Dataset notebook that shows how keras can learn from data set created using flowers and can be read in and we can use to determine an unknown flower and test the neural network to narrow down which flower we have input.
- A Mnist Notebook that shows how to use the Mnist data set to identify handwritten digits.
- The main Project program written in python and allows a user to write an image on a canvas and will train a neural network to identify what the user have written.
 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Prerequisites

```
import tkinter as tk
import keras as kr
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import math
import sklearn.preprocessing as pre
import gzip
import PIL
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw
import os.path

```

### Installing

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

Install Anaconda along with python, During the installation make sure to choose the option to add python and Anaconda to the envoirnment path. Download Anaconda from the following location.

```
https://www.anaconda.com/download/
```

Install keras by running the following command in a Command Line:
```
Conda Install Keras
```
Install Pillow by running the following command in a Command Line:
```
Conda Install Pillow
```

```
conda install numpy
```

```
conda install scipy
```

```
conda install matplotlib
```




```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import math
import sklearn.preprocessing as pre
import gzip
import PIL
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw
import os.path

```
