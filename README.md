# 4th-Year---Emerging-Technology

The Programs, notebooks and files contained here have multiple purposes:

- A Numpy notebook that shows how the numpy package works and the different distributions that are used with numpy.
- A Iris Dataset notebook that shows how keras can learn from data set created using flowers and can be read in and we can use to determine an unknown flower and test the neural network to narrow down which flower we have input.
- A Mnist Notebook that shows how to use the Mnist data set to identify handwritten digits.
- The main Project program written in python and allows a user to write an image on a canvas and will train a neural network to identify what the user have written.
 
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
